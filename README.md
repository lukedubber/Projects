Projects
========

This project was created so that I could have a Ruby on Rails site to post and update people on my projects. 
The goal is to tie it to the GitHub API, so that when you post a commit and have it tied to your project it will auto appear on the site.


Check out the active live site at [projects.lukedubber.com](http://projects.lukedubber.com) this is heavy development so itâ€™s full of Random Data and opened up. So be nice!
